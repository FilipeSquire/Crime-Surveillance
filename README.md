# Crime-Surveillance
This repository is dedicated for the project Crime Surveillance which has the intention of creating a final product, a report, about the Criminal Statistics of São Paulo City, São Paulo, Brazil. This is a initial project that aims to cover up other major cities in Brazil in the future.

The first stage of the project is to create a newer version of this abandoned project developed by Estadão - brazilian news channel - and keep it up to date.

The data that will be used to create such report is available from the State Government website about Criminal Statistics, and it may be found here:
